In their Joint Communique of 28 February 1996, the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach confirmed that all-party negotiations will be convened on Monday 10 June 1996 following intensive consultations with the relevant political parties and the completion of a broadly acceptable elective process. This paper sets out proposals drawn up by the British and Irish Governments aimed at securing widespread agreement between the two Governments and the relevant political parties on the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda of all-party negotiations.

Page 1, Agenda, 4. 
Both Governments, as signatories of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, reaffirm that they would be prepared to consider a new and more broadly based agreement, if that can be achieved through direct discussion and negotiation between all the parties concerned...

Page 2, Participation, 6. 
Negotiations will involve the participation, in the appropriate strands, of representatives of both Governments and all those political parties operating in Northern Ireland (hereafter referred to as ""the political parties"") which achieve representation through an elective process and which, as set out in the communique of 28 February 1996, establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown that they abide by the democratic process.

Page 2, Participation, 7. 
In the communique of 28 February, both Governments expressed the hope that all parties with an electoral mandate will be able to participate in all-party negotiations. However, both Governments are also agreed that the resumption of Ministerial dialogue with Sinn Fein, and their participation in negotiations, requires the unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire of August 1994.

Page 2-3, Participation, 10. 
In their Communique of 28 February, the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister said; ""They recognise that confidence building measures will be necessary. As one such measure, all participants would need to make clear at the beginning of the discussions their total and absolute commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence set out in the report of the International Body. They would also need to address, at that stage, its proposals on decommissioning. Confidence building would also require that the parties have reassurance that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiations is genuinely being offered to address the legitimate concerns of their traditions and the need for new political arrangements with which all can identify.""",GBR,IRL,200,205,315,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

P. Sharma Oli, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal, with regard to the peace process in Nepal and the request for United Nations assistance in that process (see annexes I-III).
I am pleased to report that peace talks between the Seven Party Alliance forming the Government of Nepal and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) led to the successful conclusion of an important agreement on 8 November 2006, which has now been  consolidated  by  a  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement,  signed  on 21 November 2006. Earlier this year, following receipt of the identical letters of 9 August 2006 from the Government and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), I appointed Ian Martin as my Personal Representative to undertake consultations with all concerned parties in order to build on the common understanding that had emerged. The agreement of 8 November 2006 represents an important milestone outlining the next steps in the political process leading to free and fair elections for a Constituent Assembly in 2007. In that agreement, the parties have agreed on the basic arrangements for the cantonment of the combatants of the Maoist People’s Liberation Army and the storage of the arms and munitions of both sides. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement declares the commitment of the parties to transform the existing ceasefire into permanent peace.

In this context, I am happy to inform you that the United Nations team, which left Kathmandu a week ago, held extensive yet fruitful consultations with all concerned stakeholders of the peace process here in Nepal. The United Nations team, as I understand, is to submit its report to you on Nepal.
In the meantime, I wish to inform you that further to the Eight-Point Understanding between the Seven Party Alliance and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) of 16 June 2006 and the commitment expressed by the Government of Nepal to the Agreement, the Government and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) hereby request the United Nations to provide its assistance as follows with a view to creating a free and fair atmosphere for the election of a Constituent Assembly and the entire peace process:
